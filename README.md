# Basketball Scoreboard

This was a solo project from Module 3 (Making Websites Responsive) of Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) that I added onto with CSS customizations. The requirements were that we follow the provided design and make all six buttons work.

Core requirements:

- scoreboard with "Home" and "Guest" scores
- each score has buttons to increment that score by 1, 2 and 3 points

I added onto the design so that the team with the higher score is highlighted. In addition, I changed the overall style of the application.
